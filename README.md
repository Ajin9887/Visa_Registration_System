# Visa_Registration_System

Developed a Visa Registration System using Python, Tkinter, and MySQL, designed to facilitate a structured and user-friendly visa application process. The system features a multi-step interface created with Tkinter, where users can input and manage various personal and visa-related details across different forms. The application captures essential information such as passport type, nationality, date of birth, email addresses, and visa service type in the initial form. Subsequent forms collect applicant details, address information, and passport specifics, each managed through separate windows to ensure clarity and organization. Data validation is implemented to ensure email addresses match before submission, enhancing data integrity. Integration with MySQL enables seamless data storage and retrieval, with SQL queries executed to insert user inputs into designated database tables. Date inputs are handled with tkcalendar, ensuring accurate date selection. The system also includes error handling with Tkinterâ€™s message boxes to provide real-time feedback and alerts to users. This project not only streamlines the visa application process but also demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, GUI development, and database management.
